**This software application aids electrical professionals in cable selection, conductor sizing, and installation planning, covering insulation voltage, conductor and shield cross-sections, and relevant installation details by modeling a power distribution network.**


### Select cable IDs
run
```
python3 GUI_cableid.py
```
or
```
python GUI_cableid.py
```
select the desired options and note the cable IDs to be used.

### Modeling a power distribution network with a Python script 

Section works until now : Drop voltage

distances = Kilometers

load = MVA

### Run script 
run
```
python3
```
